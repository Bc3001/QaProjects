# FirstClient
QA Test
This project showcases my end-to-end QA testing process for a live website for a client. 
The goal was to simulate real-world testing scenarios to identify performance, usability, and stability issues using industry-standard tools.

Tools Used
Postman (API and response time validation)

JMeter (Stress/load testing)

Dead Link Checker (Broken link detection)

Outcome & Recommendations:
Identified broken or malformed URLs, excessive requests, and Wix system assets that generate errors.

Recommended reducing redundant asset calls, optimizing Wix settings, and adding retry logic for failed API calls.

Created a full walkthrough video for my QA portfolio.
